# System Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

The purpose of this document is to outline the functional and non-functional requirements for the Realtime Pool Voting application. This application consists of a ReactJS frontend, a Python FastAPI backend, and utilizes Firebase as the database. The document will cover the features, performance expectations, scalability, security, and any other specific requirements of the application.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 User Management

- The application should allow users to register and create an account.
- Users should be able to log in and authenticate themselves.
- User roles should be implemented to differentiate between administrators and regular users.

### 2.2 Pool Creation and Management

- Users should be able to create new pools for voting.
- Pool creators should have the ability to define the options for voting.
- The application should support real-time updates to the pool status and results.

### 2.3 Voting Process

- Users should be able to view and participate in active pools.
- Each user should have the ability to cast a single vote for their preferred option.
- The application should prevent users from voting multiple times in the same pool.

### 2.4 Results and Analytics

- The application should display real-time results as votes are cast.
- Pool creators and administrators should have access to detailed analytics and statistics about the voting process.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance

- The application should be responsive and provide a smooth user experience.
- Real-time updates should be fast and efficient, ensuring minimal delay between vote submission and result display.

### 3.2 Scalability

- The system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users and pools without significant performance degradation.
- The database and backend should be scalable to accommodate increasing data and user load.

### 3.3 Security

- User authentication and authorization should be implemented securely.
- The application should protect against common security vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection attacks.
- Data transmission between the frontend, backend, and database should be encrypted using secure protocols.

### 3.4 Integration with Firebase

- The backend should integrate seamlessly with Firebase as the database.
- Firebase security rules should be implemented to restrict access to sensitive data and operations.

## 4. Additional Requirements

- The application should have a user-friendly and intuitive interface.
- Error handling and validation should be implemented to provide meaningful feedback to users.
- The codebase should follow best practices and be well-documented for future maintenance and enhancements.

## 5. Constraints

- The frontend should be developed using ReactJS.
- The backend should be developed using Python FastAPI.
- The database should be implemented using Firebase.

## 6. Assumptions

- Users will have access to modern web browsers that support the required technologies.
- Firebase will be properly configured and accessible for database operations.

## 7. Dependencies

- ReactJS
- Python FastAPI
- Firebase

## 8. Risks and Mitigation

- Risk: High user load may impact performance.
  - Mitigation: Perform load testing and optimize the application for scalability.
- Risk: Security vulnerabilities may expose user data.
  - Mitigation: Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms, and regularly update and patch dependencies.

## 9. Conclusion

This System Requirements Document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Realtime Pool Voting application. It provides a comprehensive overview of the features, performance expectations, scalability, security, and other specific requirements of the application. Following these requirements will ensure the successful development and deployment of the application.
